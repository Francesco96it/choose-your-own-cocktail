# Choose Your own cocktail
A collection of beer where you can choose which one should be in your fridge

We will follow [blu](https://www.figma.com/file/yGApBLVEfjfaK7E3NGpNCa/Esercizio?node-id=0%3A1) figma design.

### This app has 3 screens:
 - The main screen where a full list of beers will be displayed (with the favourites on top). We will decide if there will be a toggle to show/hide favourites. Each beer will be shown by a card displaying an image ( a default one will replace  the original if this one is not available), a title, a short description and an icon showing if is favourite or not)
 -  A second screen where the user can search a beer.
 -  A third screen with all "settings", "user" and  app info's
 -  A fourth screen will be the detail for each beer with more info's

##Separation
- A first step could be create all the stuff to make the ui/ux part work with mocked info
- A second one connect the rest api to take the advantage of real info
